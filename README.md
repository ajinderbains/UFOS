 ## Summary
 ### Drawback of current Webpage
 - This webpage is missing Clear button in Filter serach block.At present users have to refresh whole page to clear out the enteries from input boxes.
 ### Need following improvements in Webpage
 - Add clear button to filter search block, so that users do not have to refresh the page to clear entries.
 - On this page I would like to add information about how to use the filter seearch and will be easier for all users.
 - I will improve on input text boxes and will allow users to enter in lower or upper case and will  change the entries in lowercase and pull out the records matching search criteria.
